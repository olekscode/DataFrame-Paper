\section{Problem Description}
\label{sec:problem}

Context, exposed with the \textbf{most precise terms possible} (don't open
unwanted doors for the reader)

Here are the main reasons we
use EDA:
\begin{itemize}
  \item detection of mistakes
  \item checking of assumptions
  \item preliminary selection of appropriate models
  \item determining relationships among the explanatory variables
  \item assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between explanatory and outcome variables
\end{itemize}

Probably set the vocabulary before to cut any misinterpretation

Constraints that influenced the solution (because the solution is not
universal) \emph{e.g.} our requirements for a solution, possibly not all
satisfied. They should be sound and believable. Analysis of the criteria.
Imagine that you are another guy having this problem do the constraint
matches yours so that you could apply the solution

Our solution in a nutshell.


\section{Proposed Solution}
\label{sec:contribution}

Free form, variable number of sections, technical details.

But in general do not mix solution and discussions/possible variation
let that for discussion

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Discussion of actual solution \emph{vs.} initial constraints from
\ref{sec:problem}. Explain the space of the solution, why we made it this way.

Evaluation of the solution. How does the solution meet the criteria? Where
does it succeed or fails...


\section{Related Works}
\label{sec:related}

Other solutions in the domain, and a real comparison of our contribution with
solutions from other people.


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we \textsf{looked}\xspace at problem P with this context and these
constraints. We proposed solution S. It has such good points and such not so
good ones. Now we could do this or that.
